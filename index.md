# Zone
An open source alternative to the Sonos controller.

### Why
The official Sonos Player in its current state is horrible. I believe that open source always will produce better software.

### Install
To install the alpha version, just download the file for your system an double click on the executable.

NOTE: This is pre-alpha so not all features are implemented right now and there are a lot of bugs.

### How
This repository contains the source code for a node-webkit package. Node-webkit makes it easy to produce cross-platform software by using web technology like node.js.
