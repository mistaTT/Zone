I believe that open source always will produce better software.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nTo install the alpha version, just download the file for your system an double click on the executable.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is pre-alpha so not all features are implemented right now and there are a lot of bugs.\r\n\r\n(OS X) https://github.com/mistaTT/Zone/raw/alpha/builds/Zone.dmg\r\n\r\n### How\r\nThis repository contains the source code for a node-webkit package. Node-webkit makes it easy to produce cross-platform software by using web technology like node.js.\r\n\r\n### IRC\r\nJoin us on IRC by connecting to <code>Freenode</code> and joining <code>#zone-sonos</code> ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
